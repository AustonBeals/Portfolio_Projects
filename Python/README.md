# Python Projects

In my Amazon_Web_Scraper project, I create a tool in python, using the jupyter notebook, that scrapes product data from an example item listed on Amazon's website. This is used as a basis to be able to build upon, such as implementing a tool to continually check product price and react upon change (For example, a price dropping below a certain threshold).

In my Python_Movie_Data_Correlation project, I am taking publicly-available data from kraggle on movie statistics that has been scraped from IMDB to clean up and run statistical analysis tools in python to show correlating variables within the data set.
